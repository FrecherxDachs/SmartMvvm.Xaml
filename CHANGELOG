SmartMvvm.Xaml Changelog
========================

v1.2.0
------

- Extended `{Is}` markup extension to easily check `boolean` expressions for being `true` or `false`.
- Introduced a new `{Byte}` markup extension that can be used to create `byte` values.
- Introduced a new `{Thickness}` markup extension that can be used to create `System.Windows.Thickness` values where each if its properties can freely be defined using constants or `Binding`s.

v1.1.0
------

 - Fixed a bug where any logic based markup extension failed if there wasn't at least one `Binding` in use.
 - Fixed a bug where `{Less}` markup extension mistakenly also succeeded if both input values where equal to each other.
 - Changed the behavior that the range defined by the `Epsilon` property for the `{Equal}` markup extension now also includes the range boundaries.
   (e.g. 2 is now equal to 3 if `Epsilon` is set to 1)
 - Introduced a new `{Is}` markup extension that can be used to check for a specific property of a given value.

v1.0.0
------

 - First real release (no pre-release tag any more).
 - `{If}` markup extension now returns `boolean` values rather than `null`, if `Then` and `Else` properties are not set.
 - Introduced new constructor to `{If}` markup extension to provide a convenient way of comparison two input values.
 - Removed old constructor from `{If}` markup extension to prevent wrong constructor resolution from XAML markup parser.

v0.9.0
------

 - Initial release.
